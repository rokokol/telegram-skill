  cat <<'EOF'
Hold a skill's documents to the interface a foreign tool declares about itself: the
commands of a CLI as its own help lists them, the tools and arguments an MCP server
advertises, the fields an API accepts. When the tool renames one, a document that still
teaches the old name teaches an agent to call something that does not exist, and nothing
in the repository notices. Then it proves each of its checks able to fail, on planted
documents built from the same declared list, every time it runs

  check-interface.sh -d FILE [-r FILE] [-x FILE] [-p PREFIX]... [-a] [-b] [-c] [-s ERE] [-f] DOC...

  -d FILE    what the tool declares: one name per line, or a name and one argument it
             takes per line. A name `*` gives its arguments to every name, and an
             argument written <like-this> is a positional value, so bare words after
             that name are values rather than flags. How the list is made is the calling
             gate's own line: an MCP handshake, `tool help | awk …`, a recorded snapshot
  -p PREFIX  a claim opens with PREFIX at the start of a code span, or of a line in a
             fenced block after an optional `$ `: `PREFIX NAME key=… flag`; repeatable
  -a         PREFIX opens a claim anywhere in a line, prose included — for a prefix no
             sentence uses in passing, such as the full name of an MCP tool
  -b         a code span that opens with a declared name is a claim too; an undeclared
             first word there is taken for prose, and so are its bare words, which may
             be quoted output or a shell line as easily as flags, so only its `key=`
             arguments are held
  -c         a code span in call notation, `NAME(arg, arg=…, …)`, is a claim
  -s ERE     a code span that is wholly a name matching ERE is a claim to that name
  -f         a bare lowercase word after a prefixed name is an argument, as a CLI's
             flags are
  -r FILE    names the tool declared before, in the format of -d. One that is there and
             not in -d was renamed or removed, and a claim opening with it is a finding in
             every notation — under -b too, where an undeclared first word is otherwise
             prose, so a renamed command in a bare span is caught the day the declaration
             drops it. The calling gate makes the file, from the declarations it recorded
  -x FILE    excuses for the wrong calls a document shows on purpose, kept in a file no
             agent loads, so an excuse costs no request its tokens; a consumer keeps it
             beside the checker as check-interface.allow. One entry per line,
             `ID PATH [TEXT]`, excuses the findings of ID in PATH, spelt as the finding
             spells it, or only those on lines that contain TEXT when it is given; `#`
             opens a comment. An entry that excuses nothing is itself a finding

An argument is read as `key=value`, as `key VALUE` where VALUE is an upper-case or
<angled> placeholder, and with -f as a bare word after a prefix. A claim ends at a shell
operator, at the end of its span or line, or after a word ending in `.` or `;`. A name
may hold a placeholder, <source> or SOURCE, which stands for every declared name it
fits, and each of those must take the argument

The findings, by the id each one carries:
  undeclared-name  a claim opens with a name the tool does not declare, or with a
                   placeholder no declared name fits
  undeclared-arg   a declared name is given an argument it does not take
  retired-name     a claim opens with a name -r holds and -d no longer does
  stale-allow      an entry in the -x file that excuses nothing, one naming a document
                   this run does not read included, so the file stays true

Nothing here reaches the network
Exit 0 when every claim holds, 1 with one `check-interface: FILE:LINE: ID: what` line
per finding, 2 on a usage error, an unreadable file, an -x entry that is not
`ID PATH [TEXT]` or names an id no excusable finding carries, a declared list that names
nothing, or documents that make no claim at all, so a notation that stopped matching is
not read as agreement
